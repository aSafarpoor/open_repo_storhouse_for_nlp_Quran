However, the shape of the input data in each iteration and how the model's input affects its performance still remain challenging. One method is to divide the dataset into its sentences and train the model on those sentences. The problem with this method is that it would never allow the model to learn inter-sentence dependencies. On the other hand, one might use paragraphs as the model's inputs. But, since our dataset is a document-level one, it would be wasteful to ignore paragraph-level relations. To sidestep these issues, we view the dataset as a single and very long string and let the model figure out all associations, such as the definition of sentences and paragraphs. In the following steps,  we will implement this method in an efficient data pipeline."

        "Up to this point, we only have a single list of tokens, which basically contains the whole dataset. Training a recurrent network on such a big sequence is practically impossible since there is no way that we can backprop through millions of time-steps. Moreover, the GPU's memory is minimal, so that it will exhaust on the first few hundred steps. Therefore, we have no choice other than splitting the big string into smaller chunks. Obviously, by chunking the dataset into equal-sized sequences, the sentences or paragraphs might get cut in the middle. However, we should accept this tradeoff in order to train the model.\n",
        "\n",

Such restriction for such a short and close dependency can significantly hurt the model's performance.\n",

        "</p>\n",
        "\n",
        "So let's discuss why this technique is actually better. First of all, dividing the big string by batch size (which in here is 4) produces very long rows. Each row may contain several articles (as opposed to the previous method in which each row merely contains few sentences). Therefore, most of the contents between any two consecutive rows are independent. Secondly, creating batches by moving a window across the horizontal axis enables us to use the hidden states computed from the previous batch. For instance, in the figure above, we can initialize the RNN's hidden states of the second batch with the final states of batch one. Although the gradients do not flow from the second batch to the first one, the RNN can have access to some information from the previous chunk. \n",
        "\n",
        "In this section, we are going to implement the last chunking method. Specifically, you should complete the implementation of the `LMDataset.__next__()` method. In the future, this function will be used to iterate through the dataset. Therefore, on each call, it should return the next model's inputs and ground truth labels (Note that labels are the shifted inputs in the language modeling task). To implement the method, first, divide the tokens_ids by the batch size (to have equally-sized subsequences, you should drop the remainder). Then, generate batches according to the algorithm mentioned above. Please note that the final batches may not have the same window size. Also, when there are no more batches to generate, raise a `StopIteration` exception."

If we use the original Dropout on the hidden-to-hidden connection, then the RNN cell will receive a completely different mask for every timestep (in a non-recurrent layer, the Dropout mask for its inputs remains consistent through forward and backward flow). One of the methods to solve that issue is applying Dropout on the layer/cell's weight (instead of activation), which is similar to removing connections between two consecutive layers. As this Dropout only gets called once per each training step, the repeated computation of an RNN cell would not be a problem.\n",

Specifically, given a small span of text, we want our model to complete the rest of it. To implement this, we simply input the initial text to the model, and then we predict the next words step-by-step. Predicting the next word can be achieved by taking the word that has the highest probability in the model's outputs (i.e., using `argmax`). However, it has been shown that naively taking the most probable word is not the best way to do it. Instead, we should sample the next word from the distribution the model puts on the vocabulary for each step (i.e., sampling from the model output).\n",
